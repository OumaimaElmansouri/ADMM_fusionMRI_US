# Fusion Of Magnetic Resonance And Ultrasound Images: A Preliminary Study On Simulated Data

We propose a new fusion method for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) data combining two inverse problems: MRI reconstruction using super-resolution and US image despeckling, using a model relating the two modalities through an unknown polynomial function. 

For more details, see the paper: O. E. Mansouri, A. Basarab, F. Vidal, D. Kouam√© and J. Tourneret, "Fusion Of Magnetic Resonance And Ultrasound  Images: A Preliminary Study On Simulated Data," 2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019),Venice, Italy, 2019, pp. 1733-1736, doi: 10.1109/ISBI.2019.8759524.

NB: in this version of code, the relationship between MRI and US is supposed to linear.

How to run this code: Edit and run the demo script. In image folder, you can find two simulated images MRI and US images 

This code is in development stage, thus any comments or bug reports are very welcome.
